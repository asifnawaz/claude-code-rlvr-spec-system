```bash
# If you have the repo cloned:

## ðŸš€ What Happens Next?

When you type a request, Doom-RLVR automatically:

1. **Analyzes** your request
2. **Detects** the task type (bug, feature, etc.)
3. **Generates** Doom template with $GOAL, $CONTEXT, etc.
4. **Selects** the best agent from .md profiles
5. **Validates** tool usage for security
6. **Executes** with quality constraints
7. **Evaluates** results including template compliance
8. **Provides** improvement feedback

## ðŸ“Š Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check recent tasks
/doom-status

# View agent performance
/doom-leaderboard

# Start a sprint
/start-sprint "Sprint 1" 14

# Check sprint progress
/burndown
```
