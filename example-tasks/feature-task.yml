  Implement real-time analytics dashboard for user activity.
  
  Requirements:
  1. Create REST API endpoints for analytics data:
     - GET /api/analytics/users/active (current active users)
     - GET /api/analytics/users/activity (activity over time)
     - GET /api/analytics/events/stream (real-time event stream)
  
  2. Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
  
  3. Create dashboard UI components:
     - Active users counter
     - Activity graph (last 24 hours)
     - Real-time event feed
     - User geographic distribution map
  
  4. Add caching layer for performance:
     - Redis for real-time counters
     - 5-minute cache for aggregated data
  
  5. Include comprehensive tests:
     - API endpoint tests
     - WebSocket connection tests
     - UI component tests
     - Integration tests
  
  Technical considerations:
  - Use existing chart library (Chart.js)
  - Follow current API patterns
  - Implement proper error handling
  - Add loading states for UI
  - Consider mobile responsiveness
