## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Python: Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Constraints

Remember Doom-RLVR's constraints:
- **No external dependencies** - Python standard library only
- **Claude Code compatible** - Must work within Claude Code environment
- **File-based state** - No persistent processes or databases

### Testing

Before submitting:
1. Test all hooks manually
2. Verify commands work
3. Check agent selection logic
4. Ensure RLVR evaluation runs

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md for structural changes
- Include examples in docs

## üöÄ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority

1. **New Task Types**
   - Add detection patterns in `UserPromptSubmit`
   - Create optimization templates
   - Design specialized agents

2. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Enhance RLVR components
   - Add domain-specific metrics
   - Improve feedback generation

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Better visualization tools
   - Trend analysis
   - Anomaly detection

### Good First Issues

- Improve error messages
- Add more examples to documentation
- Enhance command help text
- Create additional agent templates

### Advanced Features

- Multi-language support
- Custom reward functions
- Advanced learning algorithms
- Cross-project agent sharing

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test task detection
echo '{"userPrompt":"fix the login bug"}' | python3 .claude/hooks/UserPromptSubmit

# Test evaluation

# Test commands
/kiro-status
/kiro-leaderboard
```

### Integration Testing

1. Copy `.claude` to a test project
2. Try various natural language prompts
